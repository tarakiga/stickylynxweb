# Development Status Report - 2025-07-05

## Goal
Successfully run `drizzle-kit push` to migrate the database schema to the Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Problem
`drizzle-kit` is failing to connect to the database because it cannot access the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable defined in the `.env.local` file.

## Attempts Made
1.  **Direct `process.env`:** The `drizzle.config.ts` file was initially configured to read `process.env.DATABASE_URL`, but it was `undefined` when running the script.
2.  **`dotenv` in config:** Added `dotenv` package to `drizzle.config.ts` to load the `.env.local` file. While this correctly loaded the variable (verified with `console.log`), `drizzle-kit` still failed to establish a connection.
3.  **`drizzle-kit` flags:** Attempted to use a non-existent `--env-file` flag with `drizzle-kit`, which resulted in an error.
4.  **`dotenv-cli`:** The current approach is to use the `dotenv-cli` package to load the environment variables before executing the `drizzle-kit` command.

## Current Status
The `package.json` `db:push` script has been successfully modified to use `dotenv-cli`.

## Current Status
`drizzle-kit push` is still failing with a "Connection terminated unexpectedly" error. Attempts to specify `pg` as a driver were unsuccessful as it's not a valid driver for `drizzle-kit`.

## Next Step
Verify the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local` is correct for the local Neon MCP server. The `drizzle.config.ts` has been reverted to its original state (without `ssl: 'require'` or `driver: 'pg'`). Re-run `pnpm run db:push` to confirm the connection issue.
